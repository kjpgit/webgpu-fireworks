# WebGPU Fireworks and Particle Demos

* [Live Demo of version 1](https://karl-pickett.dev/fireworks/index.html) --
some basic fireworks that only use pass-through shaders.

* [Live Demo of version 2](https://karl-pickett.dev/fireworks2/index.html) --
some more advanced particle rendering, which uses a compute shader!  (My first
ever shader!)
